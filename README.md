# Overview
The idea behind Fake AR Christmas Tree is that a cash or time constrained individual, can still participate in the festivities with a "fake" virtual tree to place in any space they want.

# Experience
* When user opens the app they will see a floating Christmas tree
* User taps a surface to place the Christmas tree
* User uses two finger gesture to scale Christmas tree

# TODO
* Add Tango UI to allow user to know when Tango is working to find surfaces
* Add instructions
* Add UI controls for placement and scaling
* Add Camera feature to snap a shot of the scene and provide share feature to export out of the app
* Allow swaping of tree model with appropriate navigation

# Acknolegdement
* Code adapted from Tango sample (https://github.com/googlesamples/tango-examples-java/tree/master/java_plane_fitting_example)
* Christmas Tree model (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/75403)
